                	<h1><span>Education</span> üìö</h1>
                	<p> I am currently attending school at Western Governers University.  I am majoring in computer Science and plan on graduating in February  2024.<br> I love the style of teaching at WGU because I am able to excel  through my classes at a faster pace compared to other universities. Within the<br> last 3 months, I have  completed 20 credits. I am able to learn at my own pace, and prove my knowledge by taking the objective assessment at<br> the end of each course.</p>

        <div class="aspirations">
                <h1><span>Aspirations</span> ‚úî‚úçüèΩ</h1>
                <p> Some short term goals that I have are to graduate university, complete internships, and land a job as a software engineer. Some long term goals<br> in my life are to start a family, travel the world, and take care of my family and friends. I think that it is important to make goals and aspirations in<br> life because it is the first step to getting yourself to a place that you want to be. Without a goal, you don't have a plan, which can lead to missing<br> opportunities, and not making the most of your time. I think that it's important to make the most out of life and appreciate the litte things.</p>

            <p> I enjoy spending my time working out, traveling, taking pictures, and playing sports. My favorite sport is basketball. I also enjoy playing disc golf,<br> volleyball, and pickle ball. These are some of my favorite sports because they are a great source of excercise and a great way to build<br> relationships. I also love to hike and take pictures of the scenary around me. I like to visit national parks and want to visit all 63 US parks some day.<br> I have included some photos that I have taken from some of my adventures in my <a href="Photos.html">photos</a></li> page!</p>
