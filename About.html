                	<p> I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Western Governors University, with an expected graduation date in September 2024. <br>I appreciate the unique teaching style at WGU, which allows me to excel in my classes at a faster pace compared to traditional universities.<br> The flexibility of learning at my own pace is empowering, and I am able to demonstrate my understanding of the material through objective<br> or performance assessments at the end of each course.</p>

                <p> My current focus revolves around achieving a set of short-term goals. Primarily, I am dedicated to graduating from university with a degree in<br> Computer Science. Simultaneously, I am actively pursuing internships to gain  experience and expand my knowledge. My long-term aspirations<br> include starting a family, exploring the world through travel, and prioritizing the well-being of my family and friends. I strongly believe in the<br> importance of setting goals and aspirations and using them as a roadmap towards personal growth and fulfillment. I deeply value taking<br> advantage of every opportunity, embracing life, and enjoying the little things in every day.</p>

            <h1><span>Hobbies</span> üèÄ</h1>
            <p> I love spending my time doing things that bring me joy. Working out, traveling, taking pictures, and playing sports are some of my favorite<br> activities. Basketball is my favorite sport, but I also enjoy disc golf, volleyball, and pickleball. Sports are a great way to keep healthy and<br> build friendships. I'm a big fan of hiking and capturing the beautiful scenery around me with my camera. My goal is to visit all 63 national<br> parks in the US someday.
